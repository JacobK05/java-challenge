# Password Generator  


## Description
I was tired of having to come up with different passwords for all my accounts because there criteria's where all different. So I Created a password generator that ask you what characters you would like in your password, to meet the your criteria. The password generator also allows your to pick the length of your password between 8-128 characters. I learned who to interact with a browser using java script. Also how a user ca interact with the web browser.
